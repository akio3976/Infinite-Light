This mod mainly focused on a more convenient way to get lighting materials, which is needed to light up your massive scale buildings under survival mode. It's highly independent, and combines well with original version with minimum modification.

Supported Version:

Neoforge 1.21.1/1.21.4


-Fluorescent Powder

An item unified almost all glowing materials. You can make it from glow berries, glow inc sacs, glowstone powder, prismarine crystals, etc. Specially it provides really easy crafting routes for sea lantern, froglight and end rod, which are hard to mass-produce previously. You can also buy it from cleric villager.
If you use it on mushrooms, some magic changes may happen...

-Leather Glue

You can smoke leather into glue by furnace or smoker. It's a kind of auxiliary item for froglight crafting.

-Pure Lamps

We have pure lighting blocks for your modern style buildings. It also have a redstone type - special property is waiting for your discovery!

-Recipes

We provide blaze powder to rod (crafting), and prismarine shard to crystal (smelting) recipes. That's especially useful when Create is used at the same time.
